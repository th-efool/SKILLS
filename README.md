# Claude Skills Library

Production-ready skills for Claude Code. Built and maintained by [OneWave AI](https://www.onewave-ai.com) -- AI consulting for small and mid-size businesses.

**204 skills** across three pillars: **business** (sales, marketing, consulting, ops), **everyday life** (personal finance, travel, fitness, job hunting), and **coding** (engineering, design, AI agent architecture).

Companion repo: **[Open Agent Stack](https://github.com/OneWave-AI/open-agent-stack)** -- installable plugins, managed agents, multi-agent orchestrators, and 7 design-token themes. Skills here stay single-file and zero-dependency; anything with a manifest, a team, or a build step lives there.

---

## Featured: /agent-army

Deploy 3 to 50+ independent Claude agents in parallel, each with its own 1M token context window. Each agent spawns sub-agents underneath. A top-tier commander (Fable or Opus) orchestrates the swarms, and you pick a power level -- Max Power, Heavy, Balanced, or Economy -- that sets the Opus/Sonnet/Haiku model mix for each layer. The system runs in waves -- execute, audit, propagate -- and checks its own work between each.

Built for tasks where one agent isn't enough: large refactors, full-site audits, bulk content generation, codebase migrations. Battle-tested on 60+ concurrent agents in a single session.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Claude Code: install a single skill
claude skill install OneWave-AI/claude-skills/<skill-name>

# Or clone the full library
git clone https://github.com/OneWave-AI/claude-skills.git ~/.claude/skills

# OpenAI Codex CLI (same files, unchanged)
git clone https://github.com/OneWave-AI/claude-skills.git ~/.codex/skills
```

Each skill is a self-contained `SKILL.md` file. No dependencies, no build step.

These skills follow the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io), so the same files work unchanged in **Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor**, and 30+ other tools -- point your tool's skills directory at the clone and go.

## Skill Format

Every skill is a single `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name                 # required — kebab-case, matches the folder
description: What the skill does and when to use it.   # required — drives auto-selection
tools: Read, Write, Bash, Agent  # optional — restrict tool access; omit to inherit all
model: inherit                   # optional — pin a model; omit to inherit the session model
---

# Skill prompt content here...
```

Claude Code loads this as a system prompt when the skill is invoked. Only `name` and `description` are required; most skills here use just those two. The `description` is what Claude reads to decide when to trigger the skill, so make it specific.
